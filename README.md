Diabetic Prediction Model

Overview

This repository contains a diabetic prediction model implemented in Python using scikit-learn and pandas. The model is trained on a dataset from Kaggle and uses various machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of diabetes.

Dependencies

Python 3.x
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
Dataset

The dataset used in this model is the "Diabetes Dataset for Beginners" from Kaggle. The dataset can be downloaded from https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-data-sets/1956887/322.

Model

The model uses the following machine learning algorithms:

1)SGD Classifier
2)Random Forest Classifier
3)Support Vector Machine (SVM)
The model is trained on the dataset and evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

Usage

To use the model, simply run the Python script in this repository. The script will download the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
